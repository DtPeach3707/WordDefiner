# WordDefiner
A web extension that defines words in Google Sheets by placing the defenition of the word in the cell element. The cell must only have one word for the script to run, but that might change in a future version. With Version 0.0.3 (and all subsequent versions) the extension now supports multiple word defenitions, as that is a customization option in the popup page.
